# Animation for Computer Games (samples) for COMP477/6311, Concordia University, Montreal

* [Fall 2019 course instance](http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~comp477_2)

Based primarily on the example demos from [Peter Grogono](https://github.com/PeterGrogono) and we
link other examples here as well gradually.

* Some examples require [CUGL](https://github.com/OpenISS/CUGL) and `freeglut`
  * `flying`, `gimbal`, `integration`, `MatrixInterpolation`, `bouncingcube` may serve as template project
  * `adapt`, `timing-1`, `timing-2`, `orbiting`, `buildcurve`
  * `bouncingball` also requires [GLE extrusion](https://github.com/linas/glextrusion) and [GLUI](https://github.com/libglui/glui)
* Look at `ogl` examples git submodule from [OpenISS](https://github.com/OpenISS/OpenISS) for OpenGL 3+ tutorials
  * Rotations: [Tutorial 17](https://github.com/opengl-tutorials/ogl/tree/master/tutorial17_rotations)
  * Requires [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* (upcoming) [Softbody Simulation System](https://github.com/OpenISS/SoftbodySimulationSystem) from Miao Song
* (upcoming) [OpenGL Slides Framework](https://github.com/OpenISS/OGLSF)
* Past COMP477 assignments and projects on GitHub from Tiberiu Popa
  * [KevinZkX/comp477-assignment](https://github.com/KevinZkX/comp477-assignment) -- can serve as a template project as well
  * Requires [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* Vega deformable objects library
* Max, PureData, and Processing IDE examples

## Layout

* `src/Demos` has code and executable animation demos
* Subdirectories have specific files with project files for CodeBlocks and VS2017 (some)
